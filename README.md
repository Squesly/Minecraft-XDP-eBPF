# Minecraft XDP Filter using eBPF – L7 DDoS Protection

This project offers a high-performance XDP-based firewall utilizing eBPF, specifically designed for Minecraft Java Edition servers.  
It effectively mitigates L7 DDoS attacks by filtering malicious packets at the kernel level (before they reach the network stack).  
Currently, the filter is available for IPv4 and supports Minecraft versions 1.8 - 26.3    
The default filtered port is 25565.

## Features
- **Protocol Analysis**: Analyzes Minecraft handshakes, status, ping, and login requests.
- **Deep Packet Inspection**: Drops invalid packets, bad VarInts, and protocol violations.
- **Connection Throttle**: Integrated SYN rate limiting (default: 10 SYNs per 3 seconds per IP).
- **Zero-Copy Dropping**: Malicious traffic is dropped at the driver level (XDP_DROP) for maximum performance.

## Installation (Linux)

### Download from releases

https://github.com/Outfluencer/Minecraft-XDP-eBPF/releases

You can download the latest build from the Releases Tab  
Then just run the executable in sudo mode or via root

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain (stable)
- **System Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y gcc-multilib wget gnupg software-properties-common git libbpf-dev
  ```
  If software-properties-common was not found remove it from the command.
- **LLVM/Clang Toolchain**:
  The build requires a recent LLVM version (CI uses LLVM 21).
  ```bash
  wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
  chmod +x llvm.sh
  sudo ./llvm.sh 21 all
  ```

### Build & Run
1.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    ./build.sh
    ```
    The compiled binary will be at `target/release/xdp-loader`.

2.  **Run the tests** (optional):
    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
    Besides the Rust unit tests this compiles the eBPF parsing code (VarInt
    reader, packet inspectors) natively with ASan/UBSan and runs its C unit
    tests (see `xdp/tests/protocol_test.c`).

3.  **Run the firewall**:
    ```bash
    sudo ./target/release/xdp-loader <network_interface>
    # Example:
    sudo ./target/release/xdp-loader eth0
    ```

    To enable Prometheus metrics export, set `enabled = true` and an `addr`
    in the `[metrics]` section of `config.toml` (see
    [Configuration](#configuration)), then run the loader normally. With
    `addr = "127.0.0.1:1999"` the metrics are available at:
    `http://127.0.0.1:1999/metrics`

**Note:** This project uses a persistent XDP loader. The userspace program must stay running to keep the filter attached; all map state (throttle windows, verified connections) is managed in-kernel via `bpf_timer`. Stopping the loader will unload the firewall. Requires Linux kernel 5.15 or newer.

## Configuration

Runtime behavior is controlled by a `config.toml` file next to the binary.
On first run it is created automatically with documented defaults; edit it and
restart the loader. Use `--config <path>` to point at a different file.

**`[filter]`** — what traffic is filtered and how strictly:

| Option         | Type   | Default | Description |
|----------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `start_port`   | int    | 25565   | First port of the inclusive filtered range. |
| `end_port`     | int    | 25565   | Last port of the inclusive filtered range. |
| `hit_count`    | int    | 10      | Max SYNs per source IP per throttle window (`0` disables throttling). |
| `hit_count_reset_secs` | int | 3   | Throttle window length in seconds; each IP's SYN counter resets in-kernel once its window expires. |
| `player_idle_timeout_secs` | int | 60 | Idle timeout for verified connections; an idle entry is removed in-kernel after one to two intervals, requiring a new handshake. |
| `online_names` | bool   | true    | Enforce online-mode usernames (≤16 chars). |

**`[xdp]`** — how the program attaches and the capacity of its in-kernel tables
(the maps are preallocated, so higher limits cost kernel memory up front):

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | string | `"auto"` | XDP attach mode: `"auto"` (native if the NIC supports it, automatic fallback to generic), `"driver"` (force native, fails when unsupported) or `"skb"` (force generic; works everywhere, slower). |
| `max_pending_connections` | int | 16384 | Concurrent connections mid-handshake; the least-recently-used entry is evicted when full. |
| `max_player_connections` | int | 65535 | Concurrent verified player connections; size well above the expected player count. |
| `max_throttled_ips` | int | 65535 | Source IPs tracked by the SYN throttle; new SYNs are dropped while full (fail closed). |

**`[metrics]`** — statistics collection and the Prometheus endpoint:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | false | Collect packet statistics inside the eBPF program. |
| `addr` | string | (unset) | Address for the Prometheus HTTP endpoint (requires `enabled = true`). |
| `poll_secs` | int | 10 | How often the in-kernel statistics are read and published. |

**`[logging]`** — console and file logging:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `level` | string | `"info"` | Verbosity: `"off"`, `"error"`, `"warn"`, `"info"`, `"debug"` or `"trace"`. Overridden by the `RUST_LOG` env variable. |
| `file_max_mb` | int | 100 | Rotate `xdp-loader.log` once it grows past this size; the 5 newest rotated files are kept. |

The `[filter]` values and map capacities are pushed into the eBPF program at
load time (via `.rodata` globals and map definitions), so changing them only
requires a restart — **not a rebuild**.  

## Troubleshooting

### Non-root / Permission Errors
Please always check if you are running as root if any error occurred. If you are not, try again with `sudo`.
